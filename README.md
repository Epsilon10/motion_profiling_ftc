**MOTION PROFILING**

This provides a basic overview of some important contents of motion profiling. Still in progress. 

You can view the content in the pdf format, or if you want to see/edit the raw latex, you can find the .md files in the "raw" folder.

In order to view the latex in the .md you need to intsall the following latex chrome extension, or install a markdown editor with inline latex support such as typora (would highly recommend this)
